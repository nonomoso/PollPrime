# PredictHaven

**Encrypted prediction markets powered by Zama FHEVM**

PredictHaven enables private prediction markets where bet amounts, positions, and strategies remain encrypted throughout market operations. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (FHEVM), the platform computes odds, tracks positions, and resolves markets over encrypted dataâ€”revealing only final outcomes and payouts.

---

## Product Overview

PredictHaven is a decentralized prediction market platform that combines the transparency of blockchain with the privacy of fully homomorphic encryption. Traders can participate in markets on sports, politics, technology, and custom events without exposing their positions or strategies to other participants or market makers.

**Core Value**: Private position management with public market outcomes.

---

## Key Differentiators

### Privacy-First Trading
Unlike traditional prediction markets where all positions are visible, PredictHaven encrypts individual positions using Zama FHEVM, preventing front-running and strategy copying.

### Homomorphic Market Operations
Market mechanicsâ€”odds calculation, position tracking, payout computationâ€”execute over encrypted data without decryption, ensuring privacy while maintaining market integrity.

### Decentralized Resolution
Market outcomes resolved on-chain with cryptographic proofs, eliminating need for trusted oracles or centralized resolution.

### Fair Market Access
Encrypted positions prevent market manipulation and ensure all participants operate on equal footing, regardless of position size.

## Market Flow

### 1. Market Creation
- Creator defines event, outcomes, and closing conditions
- Market contract deployed with encrypted initialization
- Opening parameters set (minimum stake, fee structure)

### 2. Position Entry
- Trader encrypts stake amount using FHE public key
- Encrypted position submitted to market contract
- Position tracked in encrypted ledger (amounts invisible)

### 3. Market Operations
- **Odds Calculation**: Computed homomorphically from encrypted position totals
- **Liquidity Pools**: Managed over encrypted stake amounts
- **Price Discovery**: Automatic market making over encrypted data

### 4. Market Resolution
- Outcome determined by oracle or designated resolver
- Payouts computed homomorphically from encrypted positions
- Final results revealed with cryptographic proofs

### 5. Settlement
- Winners receive payouts based on encrypted position sizes
- Market fees distributed over encrypted calculations
- All positions settled transparently

## Technical Specifications

### FHE Operations

**Encrypted Types:**
```solidity
euint64 encryptedStake;      // Position amount
euint64 encryptedOdds;        // Calculated odds
euint64 encryptedPayout;     // Payout amount
euint32 encryptedTimestamp;  // Position timing
```

**Homomorphic Functions:**
- **Summation**: Aggregate total stakes across positions
- **Division**: Calculate odds from stake distribution
- **Multiplication**: Compute payouts from odds and stakes
- **Comparison**: Determine winners and losers
- **Conditional**: Handle complex market logic

### Gas Optimization

| Operation | Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Create market | ~500,000 | One-time setup |
| Enter position | ~150,000 | Per position |
| Compute odds | ~300,000 | Periodic updates |
| Resolve market | ~200,000 | Outcome resolution |
| Claim payout | ~100,000 | Per winner |

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Batch position updates
- Cache encrypted intermediate results
- Defer expensive operations until resolution
- Off-chain aggregation for large markets

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

**Best Practices:**
- Audit all contract code before mainnet deployment
- Use established libraries for FHE operations
- Implement access controls for market resolution
- Add circuit breakers for emergency situations

**Known Risks:**
- FHE key compromise (mitigated by threshold key management)
- Oracle manipulation (use multiple oracles)
- Gas limit exhaustion (optimize operations)

### Operational Security

**Key Management:**
- Store FHE keys in hardware wallets
- Use threshold cryptography for key fragments
- Implement key rotation policies
- Secure backup and recovery procedures

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Batch transactions to reduce timing analysis
- Use anonymous addresses for maximum privacy
- Implement delayed reveal mechanisms
- Regular privacy audits

## FAQ

**Q: How private are my positions if they're on a public blockchain?**  
A: Positions are encrypted using FHE before submission. Only encrypted ciphertexts are stored on-chain, and all market operations happen homomorphically without decryption.

**Q: Can I see other people's positions?**  
A: No. Individual positions are encrypted. You can only see aggregate statistics like total market volume and current odds.

**Q: How are markets resolved?**  
A: Markets can be resolved by designated oracles, community consensus, or automatically based on on-chain data sources.

**Q: What happens if the FHE keys are lost?**  
A: Keys are managed using threshold cryptography. As long as a quorum of key holders is available, markets can be resolved and payouts distributed.

**Q: How expensive are FHE operations?**  
A: FHE operations have higher gas costs than plaintext operations, but PredictHaven uses optimization techniques to keep costs reasonable. Typical position entry costs ~150k gas.

**Q: Can I create custom markets?**  
A: Yes! PredictHaven supports user-created markets on any topic with customizable parameters.

**Q: Are markets auditable?**  
A: Yes. All market operations are recorded on-chain with cryptographic proofs, ensuring full auditability while maintaining position privacy.
